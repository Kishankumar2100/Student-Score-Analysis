# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of student performance based on various factors such as demographics, parental background, study habits, and participation in extracurricular activities.

## Data Overview

The analysis is conducted using a dataset (`Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`) containing information on student scores, demographics, and other relevant attributes.

### Initial Data Preparation

Data was loaded from the dataset `Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`. Columns were cleaned and prepared for analysis, including mapping the format of weekly study hours.

## Visual Analysis

Participation in sports correlates positively with academic performance across subjects (Math, Reading, Writing).

### Distribution of Ethnic Groups

A pie chart illustrates the distribution of students across different ethnic groups in the dataset.

### Weekly Study Hours and Total Score Analysis

A bar plot demonstrates the relationship between weekly study hours and average total scores.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into various factors influencing student performance, highlighting the positive impacts of parent's education, test preparation programs, and sports participation.
